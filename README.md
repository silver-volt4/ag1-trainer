Work-in-progress visualiser for common algorithms and data structures shown in the [BI-AG1](https://bilakniha.cvut.cz/en/predmet6546906.html) course at [FIT CTU](https://fit.cvut.cz/en)

## Build instructions

`npm ci` and then `npm run build` should do the trick. Check out the CI pipeline if you're stuck.

## Contributions

...are very welcome, on the following conditions:
- you came in contact with BI-AG1 in some way
- the code you're contributing is not written using AI (fuck that)

Made with love (and a tiny speck of hatred, iykyk) on an Arch Linux laptop with no AI at all (because I'm a weird nerd)
